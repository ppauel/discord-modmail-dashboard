# ModMail Dashboard

> [!WARNING]  
> This is an (old) work-in-progress Discord modmail project I created while learning Svelte. It is currently not actively maintained or documented, but left as an archive for reference and potential future updates.

The goal is to create a dashboard that offers session-based OAuth login and allows you to view and edit modmail-related content from a database on servers you have access to. The Discord API should not be overloaded (e.g., by implementing caching). The dashboard should provide a smooth experience with dynamic preloading and lazy loading, offering a more seamless feel compared to static alternatives.

*[Here](structure.md) is what I had in mind for the structure (if legible)*
